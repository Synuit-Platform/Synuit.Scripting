## Script Engine Plugin Framework for .NET

This framework is for developers looking to embed a script engine in their core product.

Objectives:
- Provide a framework for making applications, services and/or processes "scriptable"
- Provide an extensibility model for developing new script engine plugins leveraging existing scripting technologies (i.e. C#, Lua, Python, R)
- Simplify plugin creation by providing a common pattern and associated primatives/types.
