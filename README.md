## Script Engine Plugin Framework for .NET

This framework is for developers looking to embed a script engine in their core product.

Objectives:
- Provide a framework for making applications, services and/or processes "scriptable"
- Provide an extensibility model for developing new script engine plugins, leveraging existing scripting technologies (i.e. C#, Lua, Python, R) and corresponding open source integration libraries.
- Simplify plugin creation by providing a common "engine embedding" idiom ( i.e. set of patterns and associated primatives/types) as well as supporting tools.
- Current plugins: C#
- Roadmap: R, Python, Lua
